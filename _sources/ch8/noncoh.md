# Non-coherent Demodulation

* Suppose that timing synchronization has been achieved and that the
  oscillators employed at the TX and RX are accurate enough so that
  the carrier frequency offset is negligible.
* Under these assumptions, we may perform non-coherent demodulation
  with no further carrier information required at the RX.
