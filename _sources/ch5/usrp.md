# USRP Tuning and Calibration

We will describe different methods to tune the frequency of the
oscillator in in the N210 USRP radio using UHD APIs. Moreover, we
provide a more in-depth discussion about calibrating the RF frontend
in the N210 radio to handle the problems of DC offset and I-Q
imbalance.
