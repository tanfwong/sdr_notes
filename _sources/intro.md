Digital Communications with Software Defined Radios
============================

This is a set of course notes that I have written and am updating for
EEL 6528. The goal of the course is to introduce practical
communication algorithms and designs via the USRP software-defined
radio platform. Upon completion of the course, the student should be
able to:
* understand typical constraints in the practical communication systems,
* design communication algorithms and techniques taking these constraints into
consideration,
* proficiently use UHD as a programming tool to support development with USRP
radios, and
* implement simple communication algorithms and systems using USRP radios.
